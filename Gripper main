//main for gripper Arduino code

//research for the I/O (Hitarth)
//research for encoders (should help us find the current angle of a given motor)
//interfacing arduino 

//jaw control (Anoop)
//research on how hard to grip
//research on mopving jaw open/close ()

//computer vision
//communicate with CV team on interfacing with their code

//post workshop arduino inverse kinematics


//main loop
//use CV object detection
//translate to coordinates
//move the arm if its a valid position
//jaw control to pick up the object
//fold the arm for stability (further research)
//return to torso
