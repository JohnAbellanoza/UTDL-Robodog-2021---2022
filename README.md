# UTDL-Robodog-2021---2022
For development of the University of Toronto Design League's Robodog Project.

Development will be split into three separate subsystems: Legs, Gripper, and Torso

=== Legs ===
Subdivided into two teams: Mechanical and Software
- Mechanical team develops structure and mechanisms of legs
- Software team develops coding for motor locomotion and leg walking

=== Gripper ===
Subdivided into three teams: Mechanical, Software, and Computer Vision
- Mechanical team develops structure and mechanisms of gripper
- Software team develops code for motor locomotion and gripper movement
- CV team develops ML code for picking up objects from the ground

=== Torso ===
Subdivided into two teamsL Mechanical and Computer Vision 
- Mechanical team develops structure, component containment, and mounts
- CV team develops code for navigation and overall control of robodog
